Coined by [Jim Barksdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Barksdale), 'Bundling and Unbundling' helps business create value for customers without requiring the creation of something new. 

> My old boss, Jim Barksdale, used to say there’s only two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is unbundle. — Marc Andreessen 

> I think we use the term “disintermediate” a lot more than we do “unbundle from these terrible corporations.” - Jim Barksdale

> And so, ironically, even the people who take down an incumbent through unbundling then come back and try to do the rebundle. — Marc Andreessen
