I discovered Mimetic theory via KP’s [Substack post on Clubhouse](https://keepupwithkp.substack.com/p/everything-you-need-to-know-about/comments). 
> [Mimetic theory of desire](https://www.perell.com/blog/50-ideas-that-changed-my-life)  is a real phenomenon. Clubhouse taps into our human desire to keep up with the Joneses. We love being on the next big thing and who else to prod us into trying it than people who we admire. By giving access to top tech thinkers, Clubhouse built incredible FOMO around the product from early days. 


### What is Mimetic Theory?
Mimetic theory is the concept that people can desire anything but they don’t know what to desire, so they look to others for cues. 

> “Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind. We desire what others desire because we imitate their desires.” - René Girard


### How do you use Mimetic Theory in your life?
Be cautious and intentional of who you imitate since imitation is inevitable. 
> The most important choice in each of our lives may not be where to go to school, what career to pursue or even who to marry. It may be who to imitate. - [Imitatio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgB9p2BA4fw)
