Getting a small number of people to love you is far better than having a million people just sort of like you. 100-1000 customers that love you will tell the world about your tiny venture and give you feedback or ideas that help you make the experience much better.

*“It’s better to make a few people really happy than to make a lot of people semi-happy”  — Paul Buchheit*

#### Kevin Kelly's 100 True Fans

If you keep the full $100 of each true fan, then you need only 1,000 of them to earn $100,000 per year.

> To be a successful creator you don’t need millions. You don’t need millions of dollars or millions of customers, millions of clients or millions of fans. To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans.

> A true fan is defined as a fan that will buy anything you produce. These diehard fans will drive 200 miles to see you sing; they will buy the hardback and paperback and audible versions of your book; they will purchase your next figurine sight unseen; they will pay for the “best-of” DVD version of your free youtube channel; they will come to your chef’s table once a month. If you have roughly a thousand of true fans like this (also known as super fans), you can make a living — if you are content to make a living but not a fortune.
