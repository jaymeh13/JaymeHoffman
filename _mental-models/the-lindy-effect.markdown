> The Lindy Effect says that the observed lifespan of a non-perishable item like a business is most likely to be at its half-life. So, if a business is 100 years old, it should expect it to be around for another 100 years. And a business that has been around for 10 years should be around for another 10 years. Under the Effect, the mortality of a business actually decreases with time. - [Family Capital](https://www.famcap.com/2017/03/2017-3-16-viewpoint-family-businesses-and-the-lindy-effect/)
