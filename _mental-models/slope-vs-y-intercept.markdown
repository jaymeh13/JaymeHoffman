It’s not the Y-Intercept that matters. It’s the Slope that matters.

Knowing that your Slope is more important your Y-Intercept helps you understand that how fast you move and learn is more important than where you begin.

### A little bit of slope makes up for a lot of Y-intercept.

> So at a mathematical level this is an obvious truism. You know if you have two lines, the red line and the blue line and the red line has a lower Y-intercept but a greater slope then eventually the red line will cross the blue line.

> So in a mathematical sense it's kind of obvious. But I didn't really mean in a mathematical sense, I think this is a pretty good guideline for life also. What I mean is that how fast you learn is a lot more important than how much you know to begin with. So in general I say that people emphasize too much how much they know and not how fast they're learning...

You know the difference in slopes doesn't have to be that great if you just every day think about learning a little bit more and getting a little bit better, lots of small steps, its amazing how quickly you can catch up and become a real expert in the field.\

### From [Sam Altman](https://twitter.com/sama/status/792823320441786368)

"What's you number one piece of hiring advice?" \

"Hire for slope, not Y-intercept. This is actually my number one piece of life advice."\\

### More Slope vs. Y-Intercept

  * Good points. I would add to his last point though that hiring at least one person with a high y-intercept can increase the slope of your other hires significantly. (It's a lot easier to learn something quickly if you have someone around who already knows a lot about it.) And people who both know a lot and learn quickly are expensive and rare, so I expect the optimal hiring process would look for a large percentage of relatively inexperienced fast learners, along with a small (but non-zero) percentage of more experienced people, even if they aren't likely to develop as quickly. (Perhaps consultants would fit well in that role too.) - [tempestn](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8056031)
