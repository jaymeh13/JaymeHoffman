There are [many forms of bias](https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18). Confirmation bias is my favorite because it explains why people, including myself do a lot of silly things. Confirmation bias is favoring information that confirms your existing beliefs or biases.

Examples:

* You read/watch the news that supports your political party.
* You hang out with people that think your awesome *(i.e. your Mom üòú)*.
* You research all the reasons why your product idea will work.

I use confirmation bias on a daily basis to keep myself in check. I ask myself‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwhy are you doing this?‚Äù It‚Äôs often because I‚Äôm trying to confirm my belief. Confirming your beliefs feels good in the short-term‚Ä¶ but it prevents you from getting to the inevitable truth.

I also use confirmation bias to understand the motives of others around me. I question their thinking internally. *Why is this person sending me a link about the product idea they haven‚Äôt made yet? Why is this person telling me how great their political party is?* You‚Äôll quickly see that a lot of people‚Äôs actions are driven by confirmation bias.
