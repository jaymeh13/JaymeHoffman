Regret minimization framework helps you make tough decisions by projecting to your future self and looking backward on your current decision. RMF will help you leave your job and build the thing you’ve been thinking about for the last 2.5 years.

> I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed I wouldn’t regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried.
