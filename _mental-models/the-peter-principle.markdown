I think of “The Peter Principle” every time I consider running a 5k, golfing or going pro in Catan. 

Every person eventually rises to a level of incompetence. 

Most distract themselves in areas that make them feel competent. Few dig their heels in to overcome challenges. 

### What is The Peter Principle?
Coined by Laurence J. Peter, The Peter Principle is an observation that every member of a hierarchy eventually rises to their level of incompetence, or final placement. 

> The great work you do now will inevitably get you promoted to a job you can’t do. Distraction is the only remedy. As incompetence is the root of all evil, you need to feel competent in other areas, like bridge or knitting.
