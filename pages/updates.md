#### August 2018
* [“Good Markets”](https://jaymeh13.github.io/jaymehoffman/good-markets/) are big, growing, rich, have existing solutions and fit their founders well.
* There are only [two ways to get to PMF](https://jaymeh13.github.io/jaymehoffman/two-paths-to-product-market-fit/). Product first or market first. [Bezos preferred the latter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWRbTnE1PEM).
* I think I prefer doing consumer. (i.e. B2C vs. B2B).


#### July 2018
* There many ways founders come up with ideas. Sunbirds transport successful models to other areas, often with a twist. I compiled [a list of models that can be transported](https://jaymeh13.github.io/jaymehoffman/sunbird-approach/).
* I launched an MVP for repetitive strain injury therapeutics. People found the links valuable but not enough to pay for a solution.
* I explored the idea of a network for retirement communities. Finding a place to retire is a big problem but I don’t think i’m the right founder for this market.
