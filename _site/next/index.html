<h3 id="september-2018">September 2018</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I started working on Eons, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WxDHDHwCDBdD9vM2Q3GiN_bcpyeuK3WcUPPMNuLMuI4/edit?usp=sharing">a side project</a> that helps people set and track their long-term goals into different periods and cateogires.</li>
  <li>Network effects are responsible for 70% of the value created by tech companies since the Internet became a thing in 1994 ü§Ø - Here are my <a href="https://jaymehoffman.com/network-effects/">favorite posts on Network Effects</a>.</li>
  <li>An Idea is a starting point - not a blueprint, but a question. If an idea is a blueprint, it has to be right. If an idea is a question, it can be wrong, so long as it‚Äôs wrong in a way that leads to more ideas. <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html">PG</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/jaymehoffman/status/1040989026612928512">Four characteristics of a dreamy business</a>: 1. Customer love 2. <a href="https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/">Scale very large</a> 3. Strong returns on capital 4. Durable ‚Äì won‚Äôt change</li>
  <li>We‚Äôre taking the next 3 months off from actively trying to start a business. It feels like we‚Äôre putting the cart before the horse. We want to start a business but‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt have an idea. Most of our ideas are pretty lame and it feels like we‚Äôre forcing it. We should start a business to pursue an idea and not the other way around.</li>
  <li>We re-launched <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Keyboardgym-MVP2--AM3w_a62PFlBkOT7E91c~BmSAg-1oImxpdGIU3HbjCqdNqYz">Keyboardgym as a website</a> on Product Hunt, Hacker News and to over 200 people that favorited the repository on Github. Not a single person was interested in the solution. I‚Äôm glad we tested our assumption. The big lesson here is to test assumptions faster. We could‚Äôve shipped something weeks if not months earlier and learned people are not interested in this.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.inman.com/2018/09/05/keller-williams-acquires-app-startup-smarteragent-to-compete-with-zillow-redfin/">KW announced the consumer app I‚Äôm working on.</a> This is a testament to my restlessness - I‚Äôm leading the largest part of one of the largest consumer tech initiatives‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm more determined than ever to start and build a big business.</li>
  <li>We re-explored the idea of creating Headspace for carpal tunnel, gamer‚Äôs thumb and other repetitive strain injuries. We created a  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ootsVv4IRzM12FZZ8sTZ_FnzqSK8JEPd2RPt8_Us310/edit#slide=id.p">deck and product plan</a> to flesh out the idea.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="august-2018">August 2018</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We shifted away from the newborn project due to the low lifetime value (LTV) of new parents and high customer acquisition costs (CAC). We want to build a business where we have a relationship with our customers over a long period of time.</li>
  <li>Kate and I started the Bundle project on 8/17/18 to help new parents easily find newborn professionals and products.</li>
  <li>Good entrepreneurs don‚Äôt come up with ideas. They <a href="https://twitter.com/jaymehoffman/status/1031661566083641344">observe what people are trying to do</a>, and create solutions that help them do it better.</li>
  <li>I think I prefer doing consumer. (i.e. B2C vs. B2B).</li>
  <li>There are only <a href="https://jaymeh13.github.io/jaymehoffman/two-paths-to-product-market-fit/">two ways to get to PMF</a>. Product first or market first. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWRbTnE1PEM">Bezos preferred the latter</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://jaymeh13.github.io/jaymehoffman/good-markets/">‚ÄúGood Markets‚Äù</a> are big, growing, rich, have existing solutions and fit their founders well.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="july-2018">July 2018</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I explored the idea of a network for retirement communities. Finding a place to retire is a big problem but I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm the right founder for this market.</li>
  <li>I launched an MVP for repetitive strain injury therapeutics. People found the links valuable but not enough to pay for a solution.</li>
  <li>There many ways founders come up with ideas. Sunbirds transport successful models to other areas, often with a twist. I compiled <a href="https://jaymeh13.github.io/jaymehoffman/sunbird-approach/">a list of models that can be transported</a>.</li>
