  <li>I started working on Eons, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WxDHDHwCDBdD9vM2Q3GiN_bcpyeuK3WcUPPMNuLMuI4/edit?usp=sharing">a side project</a> that helps people set and track their long-term goals into different periods and cateogires.</li>
  <li>Network effects are responsible for 70% of the value created by tech companies since the Internet became a thing in 1994 ðŸ¤¯ - Here are my <a href="https://jaymehoffman.com/network-effects/">favorite posts on Network Effects</a>.</li>
  <li>An Idea is a starting point - not a blueprint, but a question. If an idea is a blueprint, it has to be right. If an idea is a question, it can be wrong, so long as itâ€™s wrong in a way that leads to more ideas. <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html">PG</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/jaymehoffman/status/1040989026612928512">Four characteristics of a dreamy business</a>: 1. Customer love 2. <a href="https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/">Scale very large</a> 3. Strong returns on capital 4. Durable â€“ wonâ€™t change</li>
  <li>Weâ€™re taking the next 3 months off from actively trying to start a business. It feels like weâ€™re putting the cart before the horse. We want to start a business butâ€¦ we donâ€™t have an idea. Most of our ideas are pretty lame and it feels like weâ€™re forcing it. We should start a business to pursue an idea and not the other way around.</li>
  <li>We re-launched <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Keyboardgym-MVP2--AM3w_a62PFlBkOT7E91c~BmSAg-1oImxpdGIU3HbjCqdNqYz">Keyboardgym as a website</a> on Product Hunt, Hacker News and to over 200 people that favorited the repository on Github. Not a single person was interested in the solution. Iâ€™m glad we tested our assumption. The big lesson here is to test assumptions faster. We couldâ€™ve shipped something weeks if not months earlier and learned people are not interested in this.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.inman.com/2018/09/05/keller-williams-acquires-app-startup-smarteragent-to-compete-with-zillow-redfin/">KW announced the consumer app Iâ€™m working on.</a> This is a testament to my restlessness - Iâ€™m leading the largest part of one of the largest consumer tech initiativesâ€¦ and Iâ€™m more determined than ever to start and build a big business.</li>
  <li>We re-explored the idea of creating Headspace for carpal tunnel, gamerâ€™s thumb and other repetitive strain injuries. We created a  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ootsVv4IRzM12FZZ8sTZ_FnzqSK8JEPd2RPt8_Us310/edit#slide=id.p">deck and product plan</a> to flesh out the idea.</li>
