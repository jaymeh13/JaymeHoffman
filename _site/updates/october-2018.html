<meta name="description" content="I turned down joining a startup in Nashville this month. The opportunity would have been easier, more fun and potentially more lucrative than working at KW. I would have not learned nearly as much. Turning down the opportunity helped me understand what I really want, building a successful business. My “Not todo list” is turning out to be one of the greatest investments in productivity of the year. I revisit it often, adding items and reflecting on items I should avoid. Henry teaches me so much about life. One lesson: Having a child doesn’t make it harder to focus. It makes it more painful if I don’t. There are lots of great resources for defining and solving problems. I struggle to find a good explanation for identifying problems. I believe it’s all about looking for friction — anything that gets in the way of the user and their task (job to be done). Examples: takes too much time, creates anxiety, costs too much, poor quality… Bundling and unbundling is all about restructuring value without creating anything new.
