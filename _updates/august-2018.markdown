We shifted away from the newborn project due to the low lifetime value (LTV) of new parents and high customer acquisition costs (CAC). We want to build a business where we have a relationship with our customers over a long period of time. 
* Kate and I started the Bundle project on 8/17/18 to help new parents easily find newborn professionals and products. 
* Good entrepreneurs don't come up with ideas. They [observe what people are trying to do](https://twitter.com/jaymehoffman/status/1031661566083641344), and create solutions that help them do it better.
* I think I prefer doing consumer. (i.e. B2C vs. B2B).
* There are only [two ways to get to PMF](https://jaymeh13.github.io/jaymehoffman/two-paths-to-product-market-fit/). Product first or market first. [Bezos preferred the latter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWRbTnE1PEM).
* [“Good Markets”](https://jaymeh13.github.io/jaymehoffman/good-markets/) are big, growing, rich, have existing solutions and fit their founders well.
