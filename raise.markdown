### Run a process

* Andre Farah (Density) has a  [great video on running a process](https://vc.andrewfarah.com/501de3f32d4a4e44a4dde21d25f3b9d9) .

* Watch all the [YC videos on fundraising](https://www.youtube.com/@ycombinator/search?query=raise).

### Keep your deck simple

* The  [Sequoia pitch deck template](https://www.slideshare.net/PitchDeckCoach/sequoia-capital-pitchdecktemplate)  and  [investment memo on YouTube](https://www.slideshare.net/zebs/sequoias-investment-memo-on-youtube)  are two of the best resources for creating a pitch deck.

* Vinod Khosla gives a great talk on  [pitching the way VCs think](https://www.khoslaventures.com/pitch-the-way-vcs-think-presenting-with-emotion/) .

### Make fundraising friends

* Make friends with other founders who are fundraising at the same time (i.e. [fundraising friends](https://warpcast.com/jayme/0x1a1412)).
