I [recently discovered](https://twitter.com/jhoff/status/1024103136536014853) that Netflix was NOT founded because Blockbuster charged Reed Hastings with a $40 late fee for "Apollo 13"

Instead, the founders wanted to create "The Amazon of X," and settled on DVDs...

This is not a bad thing.

The book [Creators’s Code](https://www.amazon.com/Creators-Code-Essential-Extraordinary-Entrepreneurs/dp/1451666071) classifies the Netflix founding story as a Sunbird Approach.

> Sunbirds transport solutions that work in one area and apply them to another, often with a twist. 

> Sunbirds take something that already exists and transport the model to create something new. they relocate and reshape existing concepts across geographies and industries, and bring old ideas up to date. 

> They examine how and why it worked initially, and what similarities or differences will make it work again. 

Here’s a list of proven models (Amazon of X) that can be transported to other markets.
