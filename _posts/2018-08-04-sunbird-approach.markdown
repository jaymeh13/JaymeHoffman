I [recently discovered](https://twitter.com/jhoff/status/1024103136536014853) that Netflix was NOT founded because Blockbuster charged Reed Hastings with a $40 late fee for "Apollo 13"

Instead, the founders wanted to create "The Amazon of X," and settled on DVDs...

This is not a bad thing at all.

The book [Creatorsâ€™s Code](https://www.amazon.com/Creators-Code-Essential-Extraordinary-Entrepreneurs/dp/1451666071) classifies the founding of Netflix as a Sunbird Approach.

> Sunbird approach - Here, an entrepreneur takes a solution that has proven effective in one place and transplants it to another, often with a twist.
