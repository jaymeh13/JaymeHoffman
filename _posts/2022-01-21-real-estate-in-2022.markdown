After building a home inspection marketplace, getting acquired by a top real estate company and building a global real estate app, I constantly get asked about the best ways to buy/sell in today's market.

### Agent commissions aren't really a problem IMO

1. There have been alternative options to agents in every market for decades. Few examples:

   * FSBO ($100-$400) - list your house "for sale by owner" on all the major aggregators.

   * Flat fee brokerages ($100-$500) - list your house on the MLS and get a little help with the transaction if you need it.

   * Discount brokerages (1% and/or cash back at closing) - list your house and get salaried (not commission) real estate expert to help you.

2. Startups lost

   1. Despite decades of trying to kill the agents, there are more agents than ever. There are actually more agents than their are MLS listings ðŸ¤£

   2. Not only haveThe most successful real estate startups are adding 1-4% to the transaction instead of reducing transaction fees.

3. A good buyer's agent is worth their weight in gold in this market
