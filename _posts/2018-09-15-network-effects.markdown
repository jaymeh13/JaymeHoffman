Network Effects are the most powerful force in business. 

They produced some of the most iconic products and companies ever. Examples: WhatsApp, Airbnb, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Uber, ebay, Facebook, Opentable, WeChat and Twitter.

According to venture capital firm, NFX, network effects are responsible for 70% of the value created by tech companies since the Internet became a thing in 1994 ü§Ø

Here are my favorite posts on Network Effects.


### [Anu Hariharan on Network Effects](https://blog.ycombinator.com/anu-hariharan-on-network-effects/)
[Anu](https://twitter.com/anuhariharan) gives the best explanation of the differences between networks, marketplaces and platforms.
* **Network** = group of connected users and you‚Äôre sharing information and you‚Äôre trying to drive your product. ( fb, WhatsApp, slack )
* **Marketplace** = two heterogeneous sides. So you have two sites, think of Ebay as a marketplace. You have sellers and buyers. Think of Airbnb, you have hosts and guests. ( eBay, airbnb, instacart )
* **Platform** = you have users and developers and a platform. And so think of it where both groups, users and developers, help build the platform, it can be programmatic, customized. But each group reinforces the value of each other. ( apple, microsoft, fb )

[Bill Gurley‚Äôs](https://twitter.com/bgurley) ‚ÄúAll Markets Are Not Created Equal" is a legendary post for anyone thinking about building a marketplace.

3. Opportunity for Technology to Add Value
4. High Fragmentation
5. Friction of Supplier Sign-Up
6. Size of the Market Opportunity
7. Expand the Market
8. Frequency

### [The NFX of Trulia: Building a $3.5 Billion Marketplace](https://medium.com/@nfx/the-nfx-of-trulia-building-a-3-5-billion-marketplace-53e2e738efc8)
[Pete Flint](https://twitter.com/peteflint) outlines the building of Trulia's network effects.

> Our first big challenge, one which every online marketplace must reckon with, was the so-called ‚Äúchicken-and-egg‚Äù problem. How could we attract a consumer audience (homebuyers) without any listings, and how could we attract listings without an audience?

### [A Dozen Things I‚Äôve Learned about Multi-sided Markets](https://25iq.com/2016/10/22/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-about-multi-sided-markets-platforms/)
Trent Giffin‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Dozen Things I‚Äôve Learned about Multi-sided Markets" is insightful and very easy to digest.

I recommend reading [everything](https://25iq.com/featured-individuals/) Trent writes.

1. Multi-sided markets bring together two or more interdependent groups who need each other in some way.
2. A critical difference between single and multi-sided market is that the sides interact directly.
3. Multi-sided markets are not linear.
4. A multi-sided market is not valuable if the sides can find each other easily.
5. ‚ÄúDemand side economies of scale‚Äù result when the value of a product or service changes in a positive way as more people use it. 
6. ‚ÄúSupply side economies of scale‚Äù exist when there are reductions in the average cost per unit associated with increasing the scale of production.
7. Creating a successful multi-sided market requires that the business overcome the ‚Äúchicken and egg problem.‚Äù  
8. The chicken and egg problem is best overcome if one side is clearly made the loss leader. 
9. The sides of the market should complement each other ‚Äì if the sides are complements, it not only reduces the customer acquisition cost (CAC) but assembles sides that want to to enter into exchanges. 
10. Subsidizing the side of the multi-sided market with lower marginal cost/COGS is optimal. 
11. Businesses that are slow to get to critical mass can run out of cash and momentum. 
12. Clear profit pools should exist.

The [post](https://www.nfx.com/post/network-effects-bible) and [slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/NFXvc/the-network-effects-bible-95560213) are incredibly insightful and a must read for every founder.
