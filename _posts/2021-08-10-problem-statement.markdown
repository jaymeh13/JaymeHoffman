## What is a problem statement?

A problem statement is a clear description of the problem you're trying to solve.

## Why write problem statements?

* Problem statements align efforts toward a common goal.

* Problem statements clearly define what the goal is.

  * Where... do they have this problem?

  * When... do they have this problem?

  * How... do we know this is a real problem? How will we know if we’ve solved the problem?

  * Why... is it important to solve?

* Unpacking Assumptions

  * Users want X

  * Users are doing X

  * Users need X
